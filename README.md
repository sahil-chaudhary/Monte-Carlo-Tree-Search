## Abstract
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) is a general approach to solving sequential decision making problems under uncertainty using stochastic(Monte Carlo) simulation. MCTS is famous for its role in Google DeepMind's Alphazero, the successor to AlphaGo.
Starting from scratch without using any domain-specific knowledge, AlphaZero was able to defeat not only its Predecssors in Go but also the best AI computer programs in chess, using 24 hours of training based on MCTS and reinforcement learning. 

MCTS is a widely used approach in solving sequential decision making problems and has recieved quite a bit attention in fields like Reinforcement Learning, AI and ML. 

## Projects 
This repo conists the projects which widely uses the idea of MCTS to solve a specific problem. This README file would give you a generic overview towards Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and I have tried to organize my file as systematic as possible. You can visit each of the folders and you will find a readme for the same project so that you would find it easier to understand the project.
Projects, which I have personally tried and documented are listed below:
1. Improving LLMs Reasoning abilities using Monte Carlo Tree Self-refine
2. AlphaGo
