## Monte Carlo Tree Search for LLMs

## Credits and Copyrights
The work is inspired from the work done by Di Zhang et. al in https://github.com/trotsky1997/MathBlackBox . The repo had python files which demostrated their work. The programs were not well managed and results were hardly reproducible for us(we suffered from multi processing issues because of poor threading and device compatiblity). Fortunately, @puffy310 was working on conversion of this repo into a single jupyter notebook to make sense of the paper. Although, the jupyter notebook was also flawed and had some issues which we corrected in this repo and tried to put instructions and comments so that people can reproduce the results in the paper and make commercial use of it by creating a pipeline in their AI systems.

The work is still in progress and we would share our results soon.
